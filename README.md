# web-2020
Welcome to the Introduction to Web development course, 2020 edition. In this repo you will find plenty of frontend and backend examples, and it's meant te be somewhat your class' notes. You can easily check the commit history in order to time travel to a certain point in the course (something you need might be refactored within the next couple of lessons).

You can find the backend examples inside the *ejemplos_django* directory, and the frontend examples in the *ejemplos_redux* folder. If you find some issue with this code, please feel free to create an issue, or even better, a pull request to fix it.
